## Visible React

Go beyond the docs.

Production-level code & concepts for newbs & pros.

Join me for an exploration of React in an visible style, to help you with the basics and advanced concepts of React. Starting with the basics of the Component structure and Parent
& Child relationships, to more advanced concepts like Hooks, Custom Hooks, the Store, and working with Redux & Thunk.

## Visible React?

I could call this visible react, and then have a button to show the names of the components and how they are nested.

This would be a riff off of the visible man, visible woman educational toys of the 1950s.

I would love to have the hero image of the homepage have a component over a black background, and with a light behind it showing the component structure underneath.

I would love to see if there would be a way to automatically show the name of the component. See if thatâ€™s accessible from within the component properties, and then put it on a heading tag.

The level of heading would show the level of nesting of the component.

I think clicking on the heading would show a deeper dive into the code of the component as an overlay. This would be a great use of Framer Motion.
