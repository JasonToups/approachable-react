## Why Tailwind CSS?

There are many ways we can go about styling our application, but a popular pick these days is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's an in-demand skillset and can speed up building your application once you begin to commit the classes to memory.

With Tailwind, you can style your components from within the JSX, so you don't have the leave the file to style.

## Installing Tailwind CSS in your Project.

Head over to the [Tailwind CSS Installation docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to get started.

I won't go over the steps here, since they did a great job with the documentation, and it's easy to follow.
